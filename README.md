# AI-Glasses
AI Glasses, also known as smart glasses or augmented reality glasses, are wearable devices that integrate artificial intelligence and advanced technologies to provide users with an enhanced and interactive experience. These glasses combine the functionality of traditional eyewear with cutting-edge features that leverage computer vision, machine learning, and augmented reality (AR) capabilities.

AI glasses are designed to overlay digital information onto the real world, allowing users to seamlessly interact with both virtual and physical environments. They often feature a built-in display or use transparent lenses to project images, videos, and interactive content directly into the user's field of view.

## Features

- Object detection:  The AI glasses utilize advanced computer vision algorithms to detect and recognize objects in real-time. This enables users to get instant information about their surroundings, such as identifying objects, reading product labels, or obtaining details about landmarks.

- Facial recognition: With built-in facial recognition capabilities, the glasses can identify individuals and provide relevant information about them. This feature can be used for personalized experiences, enhanced security, or social interactions.
- Voice Control Feature: The AI glasses for the blind include a voice control feature that allows users to interact with the glasses using voice commands. This feature enables hands-free operation and enhances the accessibility of the glasses for visually impaired individuals.
- Send Messages Using Speech-The voice control feature in AI glasses for the blind allows users to send messages using their voice commands. This feature leverages speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities to provide a hands-free and accessible way for blind users to communicate through messaging.
- Text Extraction-The text extraction feature in AI glasses allows users to extract text from various sources, such as documents, images, or real-time camera feed. This feature utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to recognize and extract text from visual inputs.
