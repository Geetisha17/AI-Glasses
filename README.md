# AI-Glasses
AI Glasses, also known as smart glasses or augmented reality glasses, are wearable devices that integrate artificial intelligence and advanced technologies to provide users with an enhanced and interactive experience. These glasses combine the functionality of traditional eyewear with cutting-edge features that leverage computer vision, machine learning, and augmented reality (AR) capabilities.

AI glasses are designed to overlay digital information onto the real world, allowing users to seamlessly interact with both virtual and physical environments. They often feature a built-in display or use transparent lenses to project images, videos, and interactive content directly into the user's field of view.

## Features

- Object detection:  The AI glasses utilize advanced computer vision algorithms to detect and recognize objects in real-time. This enables users to get instant information about their surroundings, such as identifying objects, reading product labels, or obtaining details about landmarks.

- Facial recognition: With built-in facial recognition capabilities, the glasses can identify individuals and provide relevant information about them. This feature can be used for personalized experiences, enhanced security, or social interactions.
- Text-to-Speech: The AI glasses can convert text into speech, enabling users to listen to text-based information on the go. This feature is particularly useful for reading books, articles, notifications, or any text content without the need for a physical screen.
